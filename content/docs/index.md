# MLEM Documentation

**MLEM** is a tool to help you version and deploy your Machine Learning models.
It turns your Git repository into an easy-to-use model registry.

Have a centralized place to store your models along with all metadata and easily
turn them into python packages, docker images or services and deploy them to the
cloud.

This section is currently just a stub, but keep an eye on this page as we're
getting a full set of docs out very soon!
