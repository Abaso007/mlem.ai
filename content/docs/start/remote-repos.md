# Working with remote objects

this is the second part of getting started, it should go after step 4 
from https://github.com/iterative/example-mlem-get-started/tags

Here user should try to commit his code to github and then load model from it
As an alternative, propose to load model directly from 
https://github.com/iterative/example-mlem-get-started

cli: ls, clone

At the end, mention that we support all cloud filesystems supported by fsspec
probably worth to have a model in public s3 bucket for users to also try out
