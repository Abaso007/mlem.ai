# Working with remote projects and objects

MLEM objects could be saved in different locations, such as Git repositories,
cloud object buckets, local directories, etc. In this section, we will discuss
how to work with remote Git repositories and cloud buckets, but the same logic
extends to other locations.

In our examples MLEM projects will exist in those locations, although it's
required for `mlem list` only. Other commands such as `mlem clone`,
`mlem apply`, and `mlem.api.load()` will work as they should whether there is a
MLEM project or not.

## Listing objects

Models and Data stored inside MLEM projects can be listed with
[mlem list](/doc/command-reference/list).

Let's list objects inside a remote Git example repository, without the need of
cloning it.

```cli
$ mlem list https://github.com/iterative/example-mlem-get-started \
  --rev simple
```

Which gives us:

```
Builders:
 - pip_config
Data:
 - iris.csv
Models:
 - rf
Deployments:
 - myservice
Envs:
 - staging
```

## Loading objects

One can use URL addresses to load objects (models, data, etc.) from remote
repositories directly:

```py
from mlem.api import load

model = load(
    "rf",
    project="https://github.com/iterative/example-mlem-get-started",
    rev="simple"
)
```

## Cloning objects

You can easily download the object to your local machine so as to use it later
using the `clone` command.

```cli
$ mlem clone rf \
  --project https://github.com/iterative/example-mlem-get-started \
  --rev simple \
  ml_model
‚è≥Ô∏è Loading meta from https://github.com/iterative/example-mlem-get-started/tree/simple/.mlem/model/rf.mlem
üêè Cloning https://github.com/iterative/example-mlem-get-started/tree/simple/.mlem/model/rf.mlem
üíæ Saving model to .mlem/model/ml_model.mlem
```

## Cloud remotes

MLEM can also be used with any cloud/remote supported by
[fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#built-in-implementations),
e.g. s3. This is useful in scenarios where objects are stored in a remote
location without the need to version them (otherwise we strongly recommend to
use [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-model-files))

To do so, one can use paths with the corresponding file system protocol & path
such as `s3://<bucket>/`

```cli
$ mlem init s3://example-mlem-get-started
$ mlem clone rf s3://example-mlem-get-started/rf
‚è≥Ô∏è Loading meta from .mlem/model/rf.mlem
üêè Cloning .mlem/model/rf.mlem
üíæ Saving model to s3://example-mlem-get-started/.mlem/model/rf.mlem
```

This model can now be loaded via API or can be used in CLI commands as though it
existed locally:

```py
from mlem.api import load
model = load("rf", project="s3://example-mlem-get-started")
```

```cli
$ mlem apply rf \
  --project s3://example-mlem-get-started \
  test_x.csv --json
[1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0]
```

## Summary

Working with remote projects and objects have several different use-cases, some
of which we covered above:

1. List different MLEM objects (models, data) in remote MLEM projects.
2. Load objects (models, data) from remote Git repositories directly into Python
   runtime.
3. Clone objects (models, data) from remote Git repositories.
4. Initialize MLEM project in a remote bucket and use it.
