# What is MLEM

**MLEM** is an open-source python tool, providing an easy and flexible way to package
and serve Machine Learning models. 

**MLEM** allows you transform your models into python modules to use programmatically, or as 
fully deployable services packaged in easily shippable docker images.

**MLEM** defines standard interfaces and formats for datasets and models, and a modular, flexible design.
This allows supporting a wide variety of model types and deployment targets, enabling you to easily
serve models locally or on any cloud infrastructure.
