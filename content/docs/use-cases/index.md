# Use cases

We provide short articles on common data science scenarios that MLEM can help with or improve. 
You can combine different scenarios for even more awsomeness.

> Our use cases are not written to be run end-to-end like tutorials. For more general, hands-on experience with MLEM, please see [Get Started](/doc/start) instead.

> We keep reviewing our docs and will include interesting scenarios that surface in the community. Please, contact us if you need help or have suggestions!
